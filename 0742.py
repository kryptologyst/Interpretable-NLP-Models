Project 742: Interpretable NLP Models
Description:
Interpretable NLP models are designed to make the decision-making process of natural language processing models more transparent and understandable to humans. These models aim to explain how different parts of the input (e.g., words, phrases, sentences) contribute to the final prediction, allowing for better trust and accountability. In this project, we will create an interpretable NLP model using BERT for a classification task. We will visualize and interpret the model's predictions using techniques like attention visualization, SHAP, and LIME.

Python Implementation (Interpretable NLP Model using BERT)
We will implement an interpretable BERT model for a text classification task. Then, we'll use SHAP and LIME to interpret the model's predictions, focusing on explaining which parts of the input text contributed most to the model's decision.

Explanation:
Dataset Loading: We load the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is a text classification dataset. It consists of 20 different categories of news articles. This dataset is useful for testing NLP models on real-world tasks.

Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed using the BERT tokenizer to convert the text into tokenized input sequences that BERT can understand.

Model and Tokenizer: We load the pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification and the corresponding tokenizer from Hugging Face. The BERT model is fine-tuned for text classification tasks.

Prediction Pipeline: A text classification pipeline is created using the BERT model and tokenizer. This pipeline allows us to make predictions on text inputs.

Interpreting with SHAP: We use SHAP to explain the model's predictions. The SHAP values show the contribution of each token to the model’s prediction. We visualize the SHAP summary plot to understand which parts of the text are most important for the model's decision.

Interpreting with LIME: We use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain a single prediction. LIME perturbs the input and observes how the model's output changes, helping us understand the model's local decision boundaries. We visualize the explanation for the first text in the test set.

By using these interpretability techniques, we gain insights into the behavior of the model and can understand which words or phrases the model relies on when making predictions. This is crucial for making NLP models more transparent and understandable.
